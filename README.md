# Full-Stack Architecture Patterns & Best Practices

A curated collection of production-proven architectural patterns, implementation guides, and technical documentation templates from real-world full-stack applications.

## üéØ Overview

This repository documents architectural patterns and development methodologies successfully deployed in production systems managing multi-tenant SaaS platforms, content management ecosystems, and revenue-generating applications. All patterns are sanitized to protect proprietary information while maintaining technical depth.

## üèóÔ∏è What's Inside

### Architectural Patterns
- **[Monorepo Architecture](patterns/monorepo-architecture.md)** - Multi-application monorepos with shared infrastructure
- **[Authentication Systems](patterns/authentication-systems.md)** - Enterprise JWT + OAuth implementations
- **[Payment Integration](patterns/payment-integration.md)** - Stripe/PayPal multi-provider patterns
- **[Dual-Mode Infrastructure](patterns/dual-mode-infrastructure.md)** - Environment-based application mode switching
- **[Shared Component Libraries](patterns/shared-component-library.md)** - Component sharing across multiple apps
- **[Testing Strategies](patterns/testing-strategies.md)** - Regression testing and CI/CD integration

### System Architectures
- **[Unified Ecosystem Design](architectures/unified-ecosystem.md)** - Monorepo ecosystem architecture
- **[API Gateway Pattern](architectures/api-gateway-pattern.md)** - Centralized backend service orchestration
- **[Content Management](architectures/content-management.md)** - Large-scale content processing systems
- **[Multi-Tenant SaaS](architectures/multi-tenant-saas.md)** - Scalable business directory platforms

### Reusable Templates
- **[AI Agent Instructions](templates/claude-md-template.md)** - Structured AI development assistance
- **[Implementation Guides](templates/implementation-guide.md)** - Technical documentation framework
- **[Testing Frameworks](templates/testing-framework.md)** - Comprehensive test suite structure

### Case Studies
- **[AdSense Integration](case-studies/adsense-integration.md)** - Multi-platform ad revenue optimization
- **[Payment System Design](case-studies/payment-system-design.md)** - Enterprise payment infrastructure
- **[Dual-Mode Deployment](case-studies/dual-mode-deployment.md)** - Instant business model switching

## üöÄ Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js, JWT
- **Payments**: Stripe, PayPal
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, GitHub Actions

### Architectural Principles
- **Monorepo Management**: Unified dependency management, shared components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across frontend and backend
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Security**: JWT authentication, role-based access control, CSP implementation
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, regression, and E2E test coverage
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation (10,000+ word guides)

## üìä Real-World Impact

These patterns power production systems featuring:

- **127+ page production websites** with Next.js App Router
- **185+ test suites** covering authentication, payments, and business logic
- **Multi-tenant SaaS platforms** with role-based access control
- **Enterprise payment systems** processing Stripe and PayPal transactions
- **Content management ecosystems** handling large-scale content processing
- **Revenue optimization systems** with AdSense integration
- **Dual-mode infrastructure** enabling instant business model pivots
